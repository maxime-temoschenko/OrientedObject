* Question 1

** How does the Coordinates class handle encapsulation ?
Variables (x and y) are private members.
Get Methods to have the value of the coordinates (public method), indirect access.
The only way to change the value of the coordinates is through translation.
** Why are there several constructors ? What mechanism is at play here ?
One constructor with default coordinates (0, 0) and one constructor with specified
coordinates determined at instantiation.

Mechanism : Constructor Polymorphism (see slides 70 of theorical lecture)

** Read main(). Do a and b reference distinct Objects ?

No, evaluation of the form : new Class() return a *reference* to this Object (Not the object itself !)
So, Coordinates b = a; just copy the reference to the object, It doesn't copy the object itself

(see slides 62)


** Modify main() to change what we have observed

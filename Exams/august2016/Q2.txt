a)
the first code will compile. we can dynamically bound
an object to a reference of a parent class.
2.
It will also compile because the reference
is the same type as the object instatiated.
3.
However the third code is not corrrect since 
we can't dynamically instantiate an object to 
a reference of a child class. since the object
has not the all the attributes of the child class.

b)
1)
Tomato
Cheese
Ham
Pineapple
Base
because the method of an object are accessed by dynamic
link and the instance variables are accessed by static link.

2.
Tomato
Cheese
Ham
Pineapple
Hawaiian
for the same reasons.

3.
Correction : 
Pizza mp = new Pizza();

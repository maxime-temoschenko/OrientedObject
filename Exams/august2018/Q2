1)
The purpose to define abstract classes is to have inherited classes
share at one time several characteristics and also to let those classes
specialize defined parts thanks to abstract methods. It enforce the 
specification inheritance and the substitution principle. Abstract classes
can't be directly instatiated.
2)
The limited form in java is that one classe can specialize one class
and specify multiple characteristics. So it can extends one class but can
implements several classes. 
a unique specialization associated with multiple specification.
3)
Whether this exceptions must be caught in the body of this method
thanks to catch clause or it must trigger the exception by declaring
explicitely into the declaration via throws keyword.

4)
This is prohibited because java genericity mechanism is disappears after compilation.
After having performe type checking, the compiler removes all information
about type paramters(type erasure).
As a consequence, one cannot program operation that rely on the value
of type paramters at rune time.

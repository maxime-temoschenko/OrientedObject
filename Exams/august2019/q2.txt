a) Polymorphic methods are methods that can take many forms.
Several methods can have the same name in a class.
However their signature have to be different.
The signature is represented by the return type, the name method
and also the number and types of its parameters.
b)

int[][] array = new int[100][]
for(int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
if( (i+1)%2 == 0)
    array[i] = new int[500];
else
    array[i] = new int[1000];

c) In java a class can specialize one class and specify an undefined
number of others classes. So it extends one class but can implements
severals one.

d) The construtor chaining is the order in which the several
constructors of the hierarchy are called. It goes from
the base to the derived class (Object class to actual class).
To do so, the java imposes that the first instruction of a constructor
is to call its parent constructor thanks to super keyword.

e) When the method doesn't catch a checked exception/ doesn't hanlde
it. It is mandatory to define that this expection is expected to be
handled by the calling method

f) notify() wakes and make it runnable again a single thread
waiting for the current object.

NotifyAll() wakes up every thread waiting for the current object.

a) Polymorphic methods are methods that can take many forms.
Several methods can have the same name in a class.
However their signature have to be different.
The signature is represented by the return type, the name method
and also the number and types of its parameters.
b)

int[][] array = new int[100][]
for(int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
if( (i+1)%2 == 0)
    array[i] = new int[500];
else
    array[i] = new int[1000];
